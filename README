The app shows the user the weather in the searched location. Alternatively, the user can use the 'find my location' button to search for the weather in their current location.

Weather data includes: 
* Current temperature
* Feels like temperature
* Daily max and min temperature
* Weather description (cloudy, clear, rain, etc.)
* Wind speed
* Humidity

The user can toggle between metric units and imperial units.

What I learnt:
figma - initial interface design was created using Figma. This allowed me to quickly test my designs before implementation, and better plan the app structure.

Geolocation API - this allows the user to provide their location to the web application if they so desire. It is accessed via a call to navigator.geolocation.
